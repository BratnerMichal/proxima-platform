This is repackaged groovysh with included [pull](https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/884).
All of this module is based on [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/), forked from [github](https://github.com/apache/groovy).

Note that this is not part of regular build, as this is built using [this commit](https://github.com/je-ik/groovy/commit/023fec6232b5d9dffda46526238df51f6c2e6ffe) and manually installed artifact.
