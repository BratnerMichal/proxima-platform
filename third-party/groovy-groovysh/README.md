This is repackaged groovysh with included [pull](https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/884).
All of this module is based on [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/), forked from [github](https://github.com/apache/groovy).

Note that this is not part of regular build, as this is built using [this commit](https://github.com/je-ik/groovy/commit/563868c24241a9d2016729c4d70807a750cb5512) and manually installed artefact.
