This is repackaged groovysh with included [pull](https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/884).
All of this module is based on [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/), forked from [github](https://github.com/apache/groovy).

Note that this is not part of regular build, as this is built using [this commit](https://github.com/je-ik/groovy/commit/9ac4740b87586a10ade12ed8683eda7856d1c02d) and manually installed artefact.
